Inspection types:
* <p>1: Pre-production inspection</p>
* <p>2: During production inspection</p>
* <p>3: Final random inspection</p>


Inspection levels:

* Level III: The most number of samples tested
* Level II:  
* Level I: Least number of samples tested
* Special Level: 
    * General levels point to a number of samples that is not realistic,
    * Inspections might take long time(e.g. doing a full function test as per claims on the retail box)
    * Checking far fewer samples does not mean the risk of non-detection is much lower
    * They end up in product destruction (e.g. unstitching a jacket to check the lining fabric)
